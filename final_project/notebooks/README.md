## Final Project Code

Here we present the code used for our final project.

- the module `tfbs_cls.py` contains the modified ThreeBody and TwoBodyTMat class for fermions
- the module `tbs_cls.py` contains the classes used for the bosonic case.
- the module `OBEpot.py` contains the potentials (spin-independent and dependent) used in the code.
- The plots are evaluated using `tfbs_eval.ipynb`
  - The contour and surface plots considering spin-depedence is contained in `tfbs_eval_spinpot.ipynb`. Only the comparison plots with spin-dependence is contained in `tfbs_eval.ipynb`.
- all other notebooks are sketches used to check our work.
